# opinions

The purpose of this repository is to convey and explain my opinions in a public but quick, clear, and quiet fashion.

## basis

This project is not meant to be rigorous or scholarly but I want to be clear, concise, and avoid confusion.

I will try to substantiate my opinions on different issues with the following items:

- LOGIC. Given the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) and the [fact-value distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact%E2%80%93value_distinction), ought/value opinions may not be purely derived from facts or what-is. Even so we all form opinions. If however I present a propostion with [formal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy), then I apologize and should appreciate having it pointed out to me.
- FACTS. These should be reasonably independent of belief. The blur between [facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact) and [opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion) is astonishing. Is it possible to have all the facts? Do you know all the facts about your father? Education varies: Some people with no formal ecucation may have a better set of facts; Two people can go to the same classes and come out with different facts. If my opinions are missing key facts, then I should appreciate being informed of the facts.
- DEFINITIONS. I may provide definitions that are convenient or context specific, and thus may vary from the vernacular or more official definitions. Definitions like axioms are in effect opinion upon which you build propostions or other opinions.
- EXPERIENCES. Anecdotal experiences are facts but like facts come in a great variety. Experiences can strongly color opinions and it is good to be aware of that.
- HEURISTICS. While not optimal, perfect, or rational, heurisitics are often satisfactory and are an opinions shared by many. I will strive to generate a small set of common sense, secular heuristics that can be used as axioms to apply broadly. Heuristics also come in a great variety. Heuristics whether good or bad sometimes become traditions.

Given the above items and context, your opinions will almost certainly differ from mine.

It is impossible and impractical to gather all of the above items about any single issue let alone all issues. However part of this project will be to collect some key items. My plan is to initially gather some of those random items and then distill them to discuss particular issues.
