# opinions

The purpose of this repository is to convey and explain my opinions in a public but quick, clear, and quiet fashion.

## basis

This project is not meant to be rigorous or scholarly but I want to be clear, concise, and avoid confusion.

I will try to substantiate my opinions on different issues with the following items:

- LOGIC. Given the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) and the [fact-value distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact%E2%80%93value_distinction), ought/value opinions may not be purely derived from facts or what-is. Even so we all form opinions. If however I present a propostion with [formal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy), then I apologize and should appreciate having it pointed out to me.
- FACTS. These should be reasonably independent of belief. The blur between [facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact) and [opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion) is astonishing. Is it possible to have all the facts? Do you know all the facts about your father? Education varies: Some people with no formal ecucation may have a better set of facts; Two people can go to the same classes and come out with different facts. If my opinions are missing key facts, then I should appreciate being informed of the facts.
- EXPERIMENTS. The scientific method has been Man's best tool for coming up with positive facts. However it needs a creative hypothesis (i.e. an opinion) that can be tested. Similarly a person's character may just be bluster if never tested.
- DEFINITIONS. Some definitions are merely tautolgies or language-games (Wittgenstein) and should be take with a grain of salt. I may provide definitions that are convenient or context specific, and thus may vary from the vernacular or more proper definitions or standards. Definitions, like axioms, are in effect opinions upon which you build propostions or other opinions.
- EXPERIENCES. Anecdotal experiences are facts but like facts come in a great variety. Experiences can strongly color opinions and it is good to be aware of that.
- QUOTES. These are often succint and witty, but also provide other perspectives, other opinions.
- HEURISTICS. While not optimal, perfect, or rational, heurisitics are often satisfactory and are an opinions shared by many. I will strive to generate a small set of common sense, secular heuristics that can be used as axioms to apply broadly. Heuristics also come in a great variety. Heuristics whether good or bad sometimes become traditions.
- METAPHORS. Metaphors are great because they take something we already know and carry them forward to something else.

Given the above items and context, your opinions will almost certainly differ from mine.

It is impossible and impractical to gather all of the above items about any single issue let alone all issues. However part of this project is to periodically dump in items, and then parse and collate these items to substantiate and clarify may opinions.
